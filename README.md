## My Process

Build the entire HTML page, then develop the CSS.

### Built with

This project was built with HTML and CSS.

### What I learned

```javascript
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

The above viewport meta tag is necessary to make the webpage appear as intended on mobile devices.

Secondly, gained first-hand practice on implementing UI fundamentals.

### Continued development

- [ ] Make the UI design better at wider screen sizes

### Useful Resources
